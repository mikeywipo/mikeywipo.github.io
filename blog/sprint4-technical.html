                    <h3>Simple problem...</h3>
                    <div>
                            There was this one time at course..that I was trying to reference to some information in a list. It was just a bit list of random test scores for four students, the first thing we had to do was sort it into smaller groups which was all good, we made everyone their own thing with their results, all good . Then we had to make another function that would add to the list. So I write the code for add a score all good then it's time to tell it where to put the score and I'm referencing the the list, then inside that list I reference to ths students name, sweet all good. Then I try run the function. No good. I go back over the code to check that I've typed everything correctly and I had so I try run it again. No good. 30 minutes pass and during that time I've tried rereading the code a thousand times and even though I was taking regular breaks I felt frustrated as! So I look at the solution...I forgot to reference it to the smaller list we made for each person. Doh! So what I learnt was it's not always the syntax in the code thats wrong, open your mind to looking at all possible problems and try to look at it from a different angle.

                    <h3>How confident do you feel using:</h3>
                    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm getting better at it. Everytime I code I learn more and more about the benefits. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Trying something</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm super confident using this method. I try things so much that sometimes I forget what I've tried. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm pretty confident with rubber ducky. Sometimes I find it hard to articulate what I trying to do but that's usually when things start to click for me.
                    </div>
                    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                    <div>
                            I really like having the instant feedback. Especially if it's a simple syntax error that needs to be changed. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm learning how powerful console logging is. It's awesome to have a visually representation of what my commands are outputting. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Googling</h3>
                    <div>
                            I google alot. Especially for finding out the meaning of something. I'm sure there's better ways to use it than how I am but I'm confident in using it the way I use it. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm pretty confident that I can ask my peers for help. Honestly sometimes I feel shy and self conscious but most times I'm able to swallow my pride. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                    <div>
                            I don't think I've asked my coach for help yet. But I'm 100 % confident I can. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                    <div>
                            I'm most confident in reflection. Since being on this journey I've learn so much about reflecting and how powerful it is to be able to review your process and improve it.
