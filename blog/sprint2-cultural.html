    <h2>My learning plan. </h2>
    <div>My long term goal is financial freedom where i have an abundance of time and money to inspire my family. My short term goal is to build a career where i'm inspired to go to work myself and one day i hope to become a full stack developer. While i'm here at EDA i would like to continue to develop a growth mindset, creativity, patience and curiosity. A couple of things i consider to be my strengths are my sense of humour, my determination and my analytical mind. On the other side of that are a few things that i need more practice in which are organisation and maintaining focus. My intentions for managing my workload is to really embrace and apply the learning framework and communicate as much as i can with everyone that i work with. If situations arise that i'm unable to workout on my own then my intention is to talk to my classmates first on slack and then go to a facilitator who i hope will be able to suggest another way to look at problem and help work it out together.</div>
