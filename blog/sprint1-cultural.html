                            <h3>Personal Core values</h3>
                            <div> Recently i made a tough ethical decision to spend time with family instead of study. I weighed up the consequences and decided family time had more value than study this time, because family is one of my core values that fuels my soul. The plan was to catch up with study later, however i felt anxious because of my choice.</div>
                            Growing up maori I've experienced the value of whakawhanaungatanga. By definition it means. 1. (noun) relationship, kinship, sense of family connection - a relationship through shared experiences and working together which provides people with a sense of belonging. It develops as a result of kinship rights and obligations, which also serve to strengthen each member of the kin group. This value has giving me a sense of belonging and identity.
                            <h3>Personal Strengths and Limitations</h3>
                            <div>Another tough ethical decision i made was to give up my job and search for a fulfilling career. This time the decision was weighed up with a different strategy. Self assessment taught me creativity is a strength so i began looking for something creative which lead me to dev academy. Fast forward to now and i'm that much closer the a career in web development.</div>
                            <div>Maori culture has influenced my curiosity and creativity through stories. i remember stories of the cheeky Maui and his amazing feats or watching Billy T James on TV. These heroes gave me someone to inspire to be like.</div>
