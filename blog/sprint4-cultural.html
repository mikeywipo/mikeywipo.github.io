                            <h3>Describe how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
                            <div>Understanding the brain and how it works allows people to learn better. Think of it like a game of hide and seek in your back yard. Imagine your it, and your playing with your closest people. sibling or cousin or neighbour or someone that you've played with before. You close your eyes and count and immediately you start to imagine where people might be. Either because they've hid in the same spot before or because you know there's only a limited number of hiding spots. Then you open your eyes and go! Neuroplasticity is like that process of imagining where people are, because you understand your environment and what works and what doesn't you're better at the game. If we apply that idea to learning, your understanding of where your brain is going to hide new information then you'll know exactly where to find it.</div>
                            <h3>Describe how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
                            <div>One idea that I had about using the principals of neuroplasticity to benefit my learning is to imagine new information like a game of hide and seek with my brain. Where I'm 'it' and it's my job to remember where my brain is hiding new information.</div>
                            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
                            <div>Practice is super important for learning. everytime you practice something that you learnt it strengthens the connections between neurons in your brain. Which makes it easier for your brain to brain to remember next time.</div>

                            <h3>Describe what a growth mindset is and why it is relevant</h3>
                            <div>Another name for having a growth mindset is being 'open minded' and accepting. This can apply to anything and everything that you want it to. The funny thing for me, is noticing situations in life where I've had a fixed mindset and thinking of how different things may have been if I had chosen to have a growth mindset. I think that having awareness of your mindset during situations will allow you to have a bit more control over the outcome.</div>
                            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                            <div>I had a definite break through with my mindset of learning. I learnt that I had a fixed minset about how I learnt. I was convinced of the idea that I only had one 'best way' to learn and that if I did that way I would learn faster. When I began to think of learning with a growth mindset I came to realise that there are man different 'best ways' that can happen at any time. Boom. Powerful.</div>
                            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                            <div>By staying open to the idea that I could learn from anywhere.</div>
