                            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                            <div> Emotional Intelligence is a term that is used to describe and measure the amount of a persons ability to feel, understand and apply their emotions for a purpose and identify and understand emotions in other people to achieve higher levels of collaboration. For example, if I'm aware that I feel scared when I'm near dogs and I'm approacing a person walking a dog then I could purposely cross the road to avoid that feeling. Or if I know that my classmate gets anxious if they're late on an assignment and we're working together, we can plan for that and try and finish early so they avoid anxiousness.</div>
                            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                            <div>IQ is different from EQ in a few ways. Firstly they're measurements of different things. EQ measures a persons emotions or feelings and IQ measures a persons short-term memory, analytical thinking, mathematical ability and spatial recognition. Secondly EQ is more valueable in the tech industry and an understanding of EQ will benefit group situations.</div>
                            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                            <div>A few reasons why I really want to learn about emotional intelligence is to improve my learning. If I'm able to learn about the emotional connections I have with situations and understand the actions that i associate with those emotions then I'll be able to apply my learnings to creating deliberate mental habits. I'm hoping that I'll have better control over my attention and increase my focus to perform tasks better.</div>
