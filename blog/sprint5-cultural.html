                            <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                            <div>
                                    I've learn't some pretty amazing things however there are definitely a few things that stick out. 1) Things that I thought I was open minded about, I was actually closed minded about. An example of this was learning. I thought I was pretty open minded when it came to learning and how I learn't until I hit a wall. On reflection,I noticed the messages I told myself were very fixed. Things like 'I can do this on my own' or 'why don't you get it' would repeat in my mind and I thought if I was open minded about learning would that really be a growth mindset message? I thought it would more likely sound something like 'How about I try working with someone else' or 'how could I make it easier for me to learn'. Another thing I've learnt is how much I compare myself to other people. I always knew I was competitive in sports, but I didn't realise how much I wanted recognition for mental accolades aswell. An example of this was when I noticed how I was feeling when one of my classmates finished a sprint before me, or made better work than I did, or both. I remember noticing feelings of anxiousness and felt like I had to do better than everyone else. Thankfully I was able to understand these feelings more which gave me a chance to let them go. Lastly and probably the most important thing I learn't was about listening. Again I thought I was a decent listener and I am, until I learn't that the most important part of listening was to do it without giving an opinion or advice. This was soo tough for me initially but now it's getting easier and easier the more I practice.

                            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                            <div>
                                    Meditation. Hands down. I was always curious but never enough to try. Now I practice daily. The most profound learning I had was around noticing feelings rather than being swept away by them. The idea of being able to choose how you feel has been epic.
                            </div>
                            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                            <div>
                                    They all challenged me in different ways but if I was to pick the most challenging I would say it would have to be identity. For me, it was really hard to look deep into what has shaped me and particularly situations that I've experienced where I had to make an ethical decision. I feel like I've had many and at the time I just trusted my instincts and trying to articulate that was tough. I'm still not sure I've done it justice.

                            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                            <div>
                                    I think the emphasis is on core learning to help us get a job. I don't know, but I think the strategy behind it is to prepare us for the culture of the industry and try and teach us skills that will improve our chances.
                            </div>
                            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                            <div>
                                    Honestly I feel like the time I've spent studying the core learning has improved me as a student, friend, husband, uncle, brother, son and person. The amount I've learnt so far was only possible due to the core learning.
