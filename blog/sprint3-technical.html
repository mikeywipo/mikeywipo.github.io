                    <h3>Describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <div>
                            Another way to think of HTML and CSS is like building a house. If you think of HTML as a newly built house, no furniture, no curtains, no pictures on any of the walls, this is just the bare structure of the house. It's nice, but it has no style, no feel. Now think of CSS as a designer, they will add paint, furniture, artwork, curtains and everything that makes the house feel like a home.  mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia. While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

                    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
                    <div>
                        Think of control flow as the order of how tasks are actioned kind of like when you're leaving the house and you need to set the alarm. If you really think about it, there is an order to what needs to be done first. Like set the alarm then lock the door, it can't really be done the other way around and Loops are things that repeat over and over and an example of this is the sunrise and sunset. Everyday the sun comes up and goes down, then the next day comes and it rises up and goes down.

                    <h3>
                        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                    <div>
                        When an html document is loaded, a browser will create a copy of everything in that html document for us to interact with. The new copy is made up of nodes and is called the DOM, and it can be changed and customized however you want without impacting the original html file. It's also useful to test how things might look on the page without changing the code. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                    <div>
                        When we access data from an array we use indexes [] and when we access data from an object we have a few options we can use dot notation or we can use brackets [] or we can even use a variable. 
                    </div>
                    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                    <div>
                        functions are basically sets of instructions that we can use to tell the computer to do. Think of it like driving a car. When you get into a car for the first time and you have to check your mirrors, and adjust your seat and put your seatbelt on. Rather than remembering all of your 'checklist' each time you can have a function to do this all automatically.
